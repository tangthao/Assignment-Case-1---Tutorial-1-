      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I am a final-year Digital Marketing student who loves anything about digital analytics. </p>
      <p> The courses Buyer Behaviour, E-Commerce, E-marketing, Customer Relationship Management, and Digital Analytics have equipped me with knowledge of digital marketing and skills of digital data analysis, which I am confident that I could well leverage to build effective digital marketing campaigns (Email Marketing, Paid Search Ad, Customer Data and Buyer Journey Analysis, etc.) in reality.</p>
      <p> Currently, I am working part-time as a grocery clerk at Superstore. As a front-end worker, this position has provided me a chance to learn about customer behaviour, while also developed my skills in customer service as well as communication - being friendly, professional and alert to customer needs as their friend.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>I would like to learn more about:</p>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>Tableau</li>
        <li>Adobe Analytics</li>
        <li>Google Analytics 360</li>
        <li>Looker</li>
        <li>PowerBI</li>
        <li>Google Tag Manager</li>

      </ul>
      <p>I heard about these platforms during learning at school. However, I have not had a chance to experience any of them, so I would really appreciate the opportunity of getting involved and working with them. Being a fast learner with inherent digital analytics skills, I am confident that I could totally adapt and get hold of my duties rapidly and effectively.</p>
